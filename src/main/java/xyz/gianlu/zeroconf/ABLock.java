/**
 * Multistage lock customized for NIO Selectors.<br/>
 * Extended rationale:<br/>
 * See, NIO Selectors take locks on their things when they select(), and don't
 * release them while waiting.  If a select happens before any channels are
 * registered, the select never completes.  If a register first calls wakeup
 * to abort the hung select, there's a small chance the select could loop back
 * around again before the register actually got called.  Adding a plain
 * synchronization around the two calls doesn't fix it, because if the wakeup
 * is inside the sync it won't get called and the select won't return, and if
 * it's outside then the loop-around could still happen and nothing's been
 * fixed.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * So, here's my solution.  Consider the following code.<br/>
 * <pre>
 * private final ABLock selectorLock = new ABLock();
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Channel registration
 * selectorLock.lockA1();
 * try {
 *   getSelector().wakeup();
 *   selectorLock.lockA2();
 *   try {
 *     channels.put(nic, channel.register(getSelector(), SelectionKey.OP_READ));
 *   } finally {
 *     selectorLock.unlockA2();
 *   }
 * } finally {
 *   selectorLock.unlockA1();
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * // Select
 * Selector selector = getSelector();
 * selectorLock.lockB();
 * try {
 *   selector.select();
 * } finally {
 *   selectorLock.unlockB();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <br/>
 * The goal is to prevent reentering `select` between a `wakeup` and `register`.
 * To that end:<br/>
 * B blocks A2.<br/>
 * A1 blocks B.<br/>
 * A2 blocks B.<br/>
 * Nothing else blocks anything else.<br/>
 * By e.g. "A2 blocks B", I mean "if a lock exists on A2, attempts to acquire a
 * lock on B will block until there are no more locks on A2."  So, in the
 * registration thread, you acquire A1 to prevent any new B locks, call wakeup
 * to get the Selector to drop its B lock, then lock on A2 to wait for it to do
 * so, then make your registration, then drop the locks (in reverse order, as is
 * custom).  On the select thread, you acquire B, then select, then release B.<br/>
 * Unless I've made a goof:<br/>
 * You can have multiple registrations occur at once, and multiple selections
 * occur at once, but never both registrations and selections, and a
 * (lock for a) registration will not wait forever for a selection to conclude.<br/>
 * HOWEVER.<br/>
 * I've only tested this briefly.  I'd want to test it a lot more before I was
 * very comfortable with it, and I don't really have time right now.  I suspect
 * it's better than nothing, at least, though.
